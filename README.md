# steamcmd (Docker image)
A base image for docker with steamcmd installed to build dedicated servers that is updated frequently. It is created but at the moment only available as ":test" branch. I will first test it, then create the full documentation. 

Creation date: 24.July 2020

Work In progress. Documentation will be done soon
